# Browser File Upload — Master Skill

## WHY CLICKING THE UPLOAD BUTTON FAILS

When a human clicks an upload button on a website, the **Operating System opens a native file picker window** (Windows Explorer / Finder). This is a separate OS-level window — it is NOT part of the browser page. AI browser tools cannot see or control this OS window.

```
❌ WRONG APPROACH (what humans do):
  browser_click("Upload button")
  → OS file picker opens
  → AI is stuck — cannot see the OS window
  → Upload never happens

✅ CORRECT APPROACH (AI method):
  Use browser_upload_file() to inject the file directly
  → Bypasses OS file picker completely
  → File goes straight into the browser's file input
```

---

## PRE-FLIGHT CHECKLIST (Do This Before Every Upload)

### Step 1 — Confirm the exact file path
Before navigating to any website, always confirm the file path first:

```
Use os_exec to verify the file exists:
  os_exec("dir C:\Users\Username\Videos\myfile.mp4")

If path is unknown, search for it:
  os_exec('Get-ChildItem -Path C:\Users -Recurse -Filter "*.mp4" | Select-Object FullName')
```

**Save the exact absolute path in your working memory** — you will need it later.
Example: `C:\Users\Usman\Videos\myvideo.mp4`

### Step 2 — Check file size
```
os_exec('(Get-Item "C:\Users\Usman\Videos\myvideo.mp4").length / 1MB')
```
Large files (>500MB) may have upload timeouts. Note this.

### Step 3 — Navigate to the website
```
browser_navigate("https://youtube.com")
```
Wait for the page to fully load.

## THE TWO UPLOAD METHODS

### METHOD 1 — Direct Input Targeting (Try This First)

Many websites have a hidden `input[type=file]` element. Find it and inject the file directly without clicking anything.

```
Step 1: Take a snapshot to check for file inputs
  browser_snapshot()

Step 2: Search for file input elements using query_selector
  browser_query_selector("input[type=file]")
  browser_query_selector("input[type=file][accept*='video']")
  browser_query_selector("input[type=file][accept*='image']")

Step 3: If found, upload directly using the ref number or CSS selector
  browser_upload_file(
    selector: "input[type=file]",   ← CSS selector
    filePath: "C:\Users\Usman\Videos\myvideo.mp4"
  )

  OR with ref number from snapshot:
  browser_upload_file(
    selector: "15",                  ← ref number from snapshot
    filePath: "C:\Users\Usman\Videos\myvideo.mp4"
  )
```

After calling browser_upload_file with a selector, the file is injected. Then take a browser_screenshot to verify the upload started.

### METHOD 2 — File Chooser Intercept (For Hidden Inputs / YouTube / TikTok)

Most modern platforms (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, WhatsApp) have a completely hidden file input — it only becomes active when you click the upload button. For these:

```
CRITICAL SEQUENCE — Order matters exactly:

Step 1: Find the upload button via snapshot
  browser_snapshot()
  → Look for: "Upload", "Select file", "Choose file", "Add video", "+ icon"

Step 2: Call browser_upload_file WITHOUT selector IMMEDIATELY after clicking
  Use Promise-like thinking: click triggers the file chooser,
  browser_upload_file intercepts it

  browser_click(selector: "upload button ref")
  ← click happens → file chooser opens in background

  browser_upload_file(
    filePath: "C:\Users\Usman\Videos\myvideo.mp4"
    ← NO selector here — intercepts the open file chooser
  )

Step 3: Verify with screenshot
  browser_screenshot()
```

**Important:** The click and browser_upload_file must happen in quick succession. Do not take snapshots or do other actions between them.

## PLATFORM-SPECIFIC GUIDES

### YouTube Upload

```
1. browser_navigate("https://studio.youtube.com")
2. browser_snapshot()
   → Look for: "CREATE" button or camera+ icon
3. browser_click(selector: "CREATE button ref")
4. browser_snapshot()
   → Look for: "Upload videos" option
5. browser_click(selector: "Upload videos ref")
6. browser_upload_file(filePath: "C:\path\to\video.mp4")
   ← NO selector needed — intercepts file chooser
7. browser_screenshot()
   → Verify upload progress bar appears
8. browser_wait(text: "Upload complete", timeout: 300000)
   → Wait up to 5 minutes for upload
9. Fill in title, description, then publish
```

### TikTok Upload

```
1. browser_navigate("https://www.tiktok.com/upload")
2. browser_wait(loadState: "networkidle")
3. browser_snapshot()
   → Look for drag-and-drop zone or "Select video" button
4. Try Method 1 first:
   browser_query_selector("input[type=file]")
   browser_upload_file(selector: "input[type=file]", filePath: "C:\path\to\video.mp4")
5. If Method 1 fails, try Method 2:
   browser_click(selector: "Select video button ref")
   browser_upload_file(filePath: "C:\path\to\video.mp4")
6. browser_screenshot()
   → Verify video preview appears
```

### WhatsApp Web — Send File

```
1. browser_navigate("https://web.whatsapp.com")
2. browser_wait(text: "Chats", timeout: 30000)
   → Wait for WhatsApp to load (may need QR scan first time)
3. browser_click(selector: "Contact/Group name ref")
4. browser_snapshot()
   → Look for attachment icon (paperclip icon)
5. browser_click(selector: "Attachment/paperclip icon ref")
6. browser_snapshot()
   → Look for "Photos & Videos" or "Documents" option
7. browser_click(selector: "Photos & Videos ref")
8. browser_upload_file(filePath: "C:\path\to\file.mp4")
   ← Intercepts file chooser
9. browser_screenshot()
   → Verify file preview appears in chat box
10. browser_click(selector: "Send button ref")
```

### Google Drive Upload

```
1. browser_navigate("https://drive.google.com")
2. browser_snapshot()
   → Look for "+ New" button

   → Look for + Create button in sidebar
3. browser_click(selector: "Create/+ ref")
4. browser_upload_file(filePath: "C:\path\to\image.jpg")
   ← Intercepts file chooser immediately
5. browser_screenshot()
   → Verify image preview appears
```

---

## MULTIPLE FILES UPLOAD

```
browser_upload_file(
  selector: "input[type=file]",
  filePaths: [
    "C:\Users\Usman\Photos\photo1.jpg",
    "C:\Users\Usman\Photos\photo2.jpg",
    "C:\Users\Usman\Photos\photo3.jpg"
  ]
)
```

Note: Only works if the website's file input has `multiple` attribute.

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Problem: "Element not found" for file input
```
Solution 1: Use JavaScript to find hidden inputs
  browser_execute_script("() => { const el = document.querySelector('input[type=file]'); if(el) return {found: true, accept: el.accept, multiple: el.multiple}; return {found: false}; }")

Solution 2: Make hidden input visible then target it
  browser_execute_script("() => { const el = document.querySelector('input[type=file]'); if(el) { el.style.display = 'block'; el.style.visibility = 'visible'; el.style.opacity = '1'; } }")
  → Then retry browser_upload_file with selector: "input[type=file]"
```

### Problem: File chooser timeout — "no file chooser appeared"
```
Cause: You called browser_upload_file BEFORE clicking the upload button,
       or too much time passed between click and upload call.

Solution:
  1. Take a fresh browser_snapshot()
  2. Identify the exact upload trigger button
  3. Click it: browser_click(selector: "upload trigger ref")
  4. Immediately call: browser_upload_file(filePath: "C:\path\to\file")
  (Do NOT take snapshots between step 3 and 4)
```

### Problem: Upload starts but fails mid-way
```
Cause: File too large, slow connection, or session timeout

Solution:
  1. Check file size with os_exec
  2. browser_wait(text: "upload", timeout: 600000) → wait longer (10 min)
  3. If still failing: browser_get_console() → check for errors
     browser_get_errors() → check JavaScript errors
```

### Problem: Page requires login before upload
```
Solution: Handle login first
  1. browser_snapshot() → find login/sign-in button
  2. browser_click(login button)
  3. browser_type(email field, "user@email.com")
  4. browser_type(password field, "password")
  5. browser_press_key("Enter")
  6. browser_wait(loadState: "networkidle")
  7. Now proceed with upload
```

### Problem: React/Vue site — file selected but upload doesn't start
```
Cause: Framework needs input/change events to detect file selection.
       browser_upload_file already dispatches these events automatically.

If still failing:
  browser_execute_script("() => { const el = document.querySelector('input[type=file]'); if(el) { el.dispatchEvent(new Event('input', {bubbles:true})); el.dispatchEvent(new Event('change', {bubbles:true})); } }")
```

## ⚠️ CRITICAL RULES — BREAKING THESE CAUSES THE FAILURE LOOP

### RULE 1 — ALWAYS include file extension in the path

```
❌ WRONG: "C:\Users\USMAN\Downloads\final thumbnail"
✅ RIGHT:  "C:\Users\USMAN\Downloads\final thumbnail.png"
```

The system will TRY to auto-resolve missing extensions, but you must ALWAYS
use the exact filename including extension to avoid the failure loop.

HOW TO GET EXACT FILENAME:
  fs_read("C:\Users\USMAN\Downloads")
  → Read the exact filename as returned, including extension (.png, .mp4, etc.)
  → Copy the FULL filename exactly as shown, with extension

### RULE 2 — NEVER wait between browser_click and browser_upload_file

```
❌ WRONG SEQUENCE (causes loop):
  browser_click("upload button")
  browser_wait(...)              ← DO NOT WAIT HERE
  browser_upload_file(...)       ← file chooser already timed out

✅ RIGHT SEQUENCE:
  browser_click("upload button")
  browser_upload_file(filePath: "...")   ← immediately, next action
```

### RULE 3 — NEVER re-check file location after upload failure

If browser_upload_file fails, do NOT go back and re-check the folder.
The file IS there. The problem is the path format (missing extension or wrong method).
Check the error message — it tells you exactly what path was tried.

### RULE 4 — State the full path explicitly before every upload

Before calling browser_upload_file, say it out loud in your reasoning:
"File path with extension: C:\Users\USMAN\Downloads\final thumbnail.png"
This prevents extension being dropped from memory.

### RULE 5 — Use absolute paths only
   - ✅ `C:\Users\Usman\Videos\video.mp4`
   - ❌ `.\video.mp4` or `~/Videos/video.mp4` or relative paths
